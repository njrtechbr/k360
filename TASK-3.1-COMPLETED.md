# Task 3.1 - Refactor UserService to use APIs - COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully refactored the UserService to use API endpoints instead of direct Prisma access, maintaining backward compatibility while establishing a clean separation between client-side and server-side code.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created UserPrismaService (`src/services/userPrismaService.ts`)
- Contains the original Prisma-based logic for user operations
- Used exclusively by API routes to avoid circular dependencies
- Includes all CRUD operations, authentication, and validation logic
- Uses bcryptjs for password hashing

### 2. Refactored UserService (`src/services/userService.ts`)
- Now acts as a wrapper around UserApiClient
- Maintains exact same method signatures for backward compatibility
- Delegates all operations to UserApiClient
- Preserves existing interface for components and other services

### 3. UserApiClient Already Existed (`src/services/userApiClient.ts`)
- HTTP client that calls `/api/users` endpoints
- Proper error handling and response parsing
- Data validation using Zod schemas
- Handles all user operations through REST API calls

### 4. Updated API Routes
- `/api/users/route.ts` - Updated to use UserPrismaService
- `/api/users/[id]/route.ts` - Updated to use UserPrismaService  
- `/api/users/login/route.ts` - Updated to use UserPrismaService

### 5. Added Comprehensive Tests
- `src/services/__tests__/userApiClient.test.ts` - Tests API client functionality
- `src/services/__tests__/userService.test.ts` - Tests wrapper delegation

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (Problematic)
```
Components → UserService → Prisma Client (Direct DB Access)
API Routes → UserService → Prisma Client (Circular Dependency)
```

### After (Clean)
```
Components → UserService → UserApiClient → HTTP → API Routes → UserPrismaService → Prisma Client
```

## Key Features

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code using UserService continues to work unchanged
2. **Clean Separation**: Only API routes have direct database access
3. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP error handling and user-friendly messages
4. **Data Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation using Zod schemas
5. **Security**: Password hashing, authentication checks, and authorization
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for both API client and service wrapper

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **2.1**: UserService converted to use `/api/users` endpoints
- ✅ **7.2**: Replaced Prisma calls with HTTP requests using fetch
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing method signatures
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling and response parsing

## Test Results

All tests passing:
- UserApiClient: 10/10 tests passed
- UserService: 6/6 tests passed
- Build: Successful with no errors

## Next Steps

This refactoring establishes the pattern for other services. The same approach can be applied to:
- AttendantService (Task 3.2)
- EvaluationService (Task 3.3) 
- ModuleService (Task 3.4)
- GamificationService (Task 4.1)
- XpAvulsoService (Task 4.2)
- RhService (Task 4.3)
